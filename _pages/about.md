PhD candidate in Neuroscience at University of Geneva studying neural mechanisms of integration, compression, and compositionality in language.

Currently researching neural mechanisms of binding: How are two representations integrated into one? Can the same process be applied accross multiple levels of hierarchy to form increasingly complex representations? Is the contained information represented in a compressed format? Using MEG and a combination of decoding and oscillation analyses, I aim to discover what neural activity supports binding during langauge comprehension.

I am supervised by [Prof. Nina Kazanina](https://www.ninakazanina.com/) at University of Geneva and I am a part of the [Lemanic Neuroscience Doctoral School](https://wp.unil.ch/lemanicneuroscience/).
