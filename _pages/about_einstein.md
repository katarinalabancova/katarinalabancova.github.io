PhD candidate in Neuroscience at University of Geneva studying neural mechanisms of 
integration, compression and compositionality in language.

Currently researching neural mechanisms of binding: How are two representations integrated into one? Can the same process be applied accross multiple levels of hierarchy to form increasingly complex representations? Is the contained information represented in a compressed format? Using MEG and a combination of anadecoding and oscillation analyses , I am to discover what neural activity supports this process during langauge comprehension.

I work with Prof. Nina Kazanina at University of Geneva and I am a pard of the Lemanic Neuroscience Doctoral School.
