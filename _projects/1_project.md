My current research focuses on binding. What is binding and why is it important for language comprehension?

When someone says “I saw a good bird documentary” we understand that it’s a good documentary about birds, not a documentary about good birds. For this, we need to bind the words together in the correct configuration. Being able to do this is a fundamental property of language because binding concepts into more and more complex concepts is what helps us form phrases and sentences and later narratives and stories. Through this one mechanism, we can build a hierarchical structure, which is what underlies all human language. But also more than that. This ability to achieve such complex and structured understanding is what sets us apart from chimpanzees and supports many complex human behaviours. My research isolates this one important binding mechanism that lies at the heart of it all and I look for the neural mechanism that allows it.


#### Academic abstract:
We perceive language only one word at a time, but our understanding of what is being said grows cumulatively. During language comprehension, earlier information must be maintained until it can be integrated with the rest of the input. This necessitates a working memory system able to dynamically encode, maintain, update, and retrieve structured information. Through integration, working memory representations must be compressed to reduce memory load but stay flexible to accommodate incoming information. This project investigates how input is repackaged into operable intermediate-memory representations in real time, and what neural dynamics support this process. We designed an MEG experiment and plan to conduct multivariate and spectral analyses to investigate the neural signatures of binding across multiple levels if hierarchy.
